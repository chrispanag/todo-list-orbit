# todo-list-orbit

A simple React application that uses [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb) to store and display a list of todo items in a decentralized manner.

Live example: [https://todo-list-orbit.on.fleek.co/](https://todo-list-orbit.on.fleek.co/)

## How to use

Firstly install using `yarn install` and hit `yarn start` to start the app.

1. Open localhost:3000 on two windows, one incognito and one regular. 
2. Write a name on the textbox on the first window (whatever you want)
3. Hit Create
4. When the address shows up, copy it
5. Paste it on the textbox on the second window
6. Hit connect
7. Wait till address shows up
8. Add data to one of the two windows
9. Wait till the magic happens
(then you can change data on both windows, and they will sync up!)
